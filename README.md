This repo contains the files for the PCMLAI Module 17 Practical Assignment 3

## Overview
In this practical application, your goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers we encountered in this section, namely K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.  We will utilize a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone.  

## Getting Started
Our dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).  The data is from a Portugese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns.

### Problem 1: Understanding the Data

To gain a better understanding of the data, please read the information provided in the UCI link above, and examine the **Materials and Methods** section of the paper.  How many marketing campaigns does this data represent?

- The data from a Portugese banking institute gives the results of direct marketing campains done by the company. These campains were done through hpone calls. The phone calls involve telephone and celular calls. In total, there were 41,188 calls. Of these calls, 15,044 were telephone calls and 26,144 were cellular calls. The highest number of times contact had to be made during the campaign is 56 times.

### Problem 2: Read in the Data

Use pandas to read in the dataset `bank-additional-full.csv` and assign to a meaningful variable name.

- It should be noted that the UCI Machine Learning repository provided multiple versions of this datasets which includes samples of the original dataset. For the purpose of this project, only the original full dataset was read in so that the data could persoanally and easily be slit for training and testing.

  ### Problem 3: Understanding the Features


Examine the data description below, and determine if any of the features are missing values or need to be coerced to a different data type.


```
Input variables:
# bank client data:
1 - age (numeric)
2 - job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')
3 - marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
4 - education (categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')
5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
# related with the last contact of the current campaign:
8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone')
9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')
10 - day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
# other attributes:
12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')
# social and economic context attributes
16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)
18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)
19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)

Output variable (desired target):
21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')
```

- There are no missing values from this dataset. However, it should be noted that this datset is significantly unbalanced with about 88.73% of people choosing not subscribe and only 11.27% of people choosing to subscribe. This dataset is filled with floats, integers, and objects. Some features may need to be converted later during feature selection before modeling. This dataset was filled with a few duplicates which were removed
- During this time, some data analysis was reformed to identify some features that are likely to affact the target outcome to help with modleing and predicting. Through a histogram visualizing the job column of the dataset, it can be seen that there are various jobs that have a higher rate of choosing to subscribe to the term deposit. These jobs include admin, technician, and more.

- During data analysis, the jobs admin, technician, student, and retired were chosen for comparison as despite the lower number of subscritions, fewer retired people and students were contacted, making the percentage who subscribed within those specific groups high. The comparision was made between married individuals with a technician, admin, student, or retired job to all others. The results showed that of the married individuals with a technician, admin, student, or retired job, 14.47% said yes to subscribing while 10.83% of all others said yes. This shows that these jobs and a married status are characteristics that are likely to lead to saying yes to a subscription. It should be noted that the high "no" rate has been observed but will not be extremely important considering how significantly unbalanced the data is.

- ANother comparision performed was between those with a university degree and no personal loan and all others. These features were chosen as those with a university degree are likely to make more money than those without one. The lack of personal loans means that these individuals likely do not have any major debt, like a student loan, that would prevent them from saying yes to a subscription. The results of the anaylsis show that 13.98% of those with a university dgeree and no personaly loan said "yes" to a subscription while 10.40% of all others said "yes".

### Problem 4: Understanding the Task

After examining the description and data, your goal now is to clearly state the *Business Objective* of the task.  State the objective below.

- A Portuguese banking institution is attempting get more clients to subscribe to a term deposit. The institution is reaching out the various clients through phone calls. Unfortunately, individual phone calls must be made to various clients with eac client likly requiring multiple calls. This is time consuming and unrewarding, especially if the client refusing to subscribe to a term deposit. Therefore, the Portuguese banking institution must figure out which charateristics describe a client that will likely say 'yes' to subscribing to a term deposit. Using classification models to determmine the accurate model with the best features, the insttution will be able to direct their marketing campain to clients that are more likely to subscribe which will bring in more business to the insituation.

### Problem 5: Engineering Features

Now that you understand your business objective, we will build a basic model to get started.  Before we can do this, we must work to encode the data.  Using just the bank information features, prepare the features and target column for modeling with appropriate encoding and transformations.

- To prepare the features for modeling, encoding had to be done as many of the seemingly important features were nonnumerical. For starters, the "y" column which displayed the target variable of rather someone said "yes" or "no" to the subscribtion was encoded. "No" is represted by "0" and "yes" is represented by "1". Further visualization were done to identify features that would be encoded versus those that would be kept. The categorical features that were visualized includes the job, marital, education, default, housing, loan, month, and day_of_week columns. These visualizations show how many more people above the mean choose to subscribe out of all the people within each category. For example, although more people with an admin job said "yes", these visualizations show that out of the total number of students asked, most of them said "yes" compared to other jobs. These plots can also help with feature selection as it contributed to choosing retired and student for data analysis.
![The acceptance of categorical features](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fbfb67e-54b1-4f9d-b417-12487dc80982)

- The nonnumerical features that went through label encoding include the job, marital, education, housing, loan, month, and day_of_week features. Although not all of these features are used for modeling, they can be used for further/future modleing. The features that were removed include the default, contact, poutcome, and duration features. This is because the default column was significatly imbalaned with only 3 people with a default loan; therefore, this column likely does not have an affect on modeling and predicting. Contact was removed as it does not seem to be very important beyond data recording. The poutcome column was deleted as most of the values were "nonexistent". Despite being deemed important, the duration coulmn was deleted as the duration of the call cannot be determined prior to the call; therefore, this column holds no value for predictive modeling. After encoding, the index was reset.

  ### Problem 6: Train/Test Split

With your data prepared, split it into a train and test set.

- The data was split with the test size being 20%, leaving 80% of the data for training. The features that will be used for basic modeling are the job and marital features. The "y" colunn listing if the person choose to subscribe or not is the target.

### Problem 7: A Baseline Model

Before we build our first model, we want to establish a baseline.  What is the baseline performance that our classifier should aim to beat?

- A random classifier model was used as the baseline. This model took about 0.0044 seconds to train. Recall will be the initial evaluation metric with a confusion matrix being used as well. The recall score of the random classifier model is about 0.5031. There were a significant number of true positives and a low number of true negatives. However, the number of false negatives and false positives were about the same and higher than the true positives. This is the baseline performance that we should aim to beat.

### Problem 8: A Simple Model

Use Logistic Regression to build a basic model on your data.  

- A logistic regression model was built within 0.0199 seconds.

### Problem 9: Score the Model

What is the accuracy of your model?

- The recall score of the logistic model was 0.5. From the confusion matrix, there is a high number of true positives with the rest going to the false positives. There were no false negatives or true negatives.

### Problem 10: Model Comparisons

Now, we aim to compare the performance of the Logistic Regression model to our KNN algorithm, Decision Tree, and SVM models.  Using the default settings for each of the models, fit and score each.  Also, be sure to compare the fit time of each of the models.  Present your findings in a `DataFrame` similar to that below:

| Model | Train Time | Train Accuracy | Test Accuracy |
| ----- | ---------- | -------------  | -----------   |
|     |    |     |     |
