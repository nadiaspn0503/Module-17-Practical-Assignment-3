This repo contains the files for the PCMLAI Module 17 Practical Assignment 3

## Overview
In this practical application, your goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers we encountered in this section, namely K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.  We will utilize a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone.  

## Getting Started
Our dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository [link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing).  The data is from a Portugese banking institution and is a collection of the results of multiple marketing campaigns.  We will make use of the article accompanying the dataset [here](CRISP-DM-BANK.pdf) for more information on the data and features.
